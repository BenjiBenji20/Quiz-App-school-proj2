This project is for completion for the course System Integration and Architecture 1.
This is my second project using Nodejs and express js. So a lot of loop holes are visible here but I still considered this project as successfull, because man, I'm a full beginner.

The tech stack used:
Nodejs for backend
Expressjs for server side
Mongodb for database
EJS as view engine
CSS, Bootstrap and JS for design

Modules:
Axios for fast api fetching
Mongoose for mongodb 
env
btcryp for password hashed
jwt for web token
joi for input validation
